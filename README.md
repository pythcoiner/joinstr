# Disclaimer

This library is at (very) experimental stage, we do not advice to use it on mainnet.
There is still some minor differences at the protocol level between this  implementation
and the python & kotlin implementations, but we should fix it soon.

# Joinstr protocol

# Transaction Inputs/Outputs types

As of now, we have only implemented the protocol for using **Segwitv0** inputs & outputs.

# VPN/Tor

For now there is no plan to implement VPN or Tor support in this lib, as it's expected 
to be handled at consumer or OS level.

# Project organisation:

The rust library can be found [here](./rust/joinstr).
